Story is based on depth.
	You are falling down, further, always
	Fear of Depths - Jacob Geller
	Metaphorical stuff yeah yeah
	maybe even those renders you made a while ago
Supernatural elements
	Manual gravity flip could be a piece of supernatural tech
	Explains how they can dig so far "down"
	maybe a town of them that is abandoned (and sideways)? Outer Wilds
	First thing you see of this town is the trash (death pits for normal platforming)
Graphics
	Rendered like DK:C 3D models (lotsa dithering etc)
