Celeste
	Mainly difficulty
	Play through the game + make notes on level design
	Good Music

The Thing TM
	Level can flip onto its side, with you falling instead.
	This does not affect the camera, so it may appear you are falling sideways
	First few levels this is triggered by level triggers
	Around halfway through the game, it can be triggered manually using player buttons
	Story elements paced by a buddy catching up with you after falling in sidewards grav for a long time
	Need to test every level sideways AND normal once player has flip ability
Darkness
	Camera is close (similar to Limbo more than Mario)
	Fog of War
