Articles I Recommend:
Please read all the bandcamp descriptions for each LP, you can find some super interesting context in there a lot of the time. I recommend reading:
	https://pwelverumandsun.bandcamp.com/album/nobodys-perfect
	(also this album, [[Nobody's Perfect]], is really slept on)
	(try to imagine a baby vulture! :]])

In this thing I talk about the overarching narrative of Phil's works a LOT, and while that may seem strange at first, I think when looking at the work Phil has put out, its quite obvious that a lot of it is "narrative" in nature.
	"The way I write songs, or think about albums, and the way they flow together,â€¦is in terms of telling a story and different scenes and different characters coming and reappearing,"
-he told http://www.sweetthunder.org (at least I think? their website seems to be down and I got this info second hand)

Of course as he mainly reveals in his new work ([[Microphones in 2020]]), a lot of this narrative structure was mainly just an attempt to categorise and give an overarching narrative to his- at times- sporadic and unconnected ideas/songs.
