Mount Eerie is an extremely important LP in the overarching "narrative" of Phil's work and I think it symbolises the "death" of the character in [[It Was Hot, We Stayed In The Water]] and [[The Glow, Pt. 2]]. It has been described as:
	The concept album to end all concept albums. … meets a mean motherfucker called King Dark Death at the summit who kills him and leaves his body for vultures to eat, only for him to become one with the universe, along with some of the most stunningly cinematic production I've heard on a record.

Immediately after this record, of course, the project of The Microphones is concluded. And at the end of the record, atop and above the summit, the project of Mount Eerie is formed. A universal, sprawling stare deep into the heart of nature itself.
	"I am not satisfied with the ending of _Mount Eerie_ the album, so maybe by calling myself that, I am attempting to elaborate on the ending."
-he tells _Discorder_
