Dawn is a significant album in Mount Eerie's discography, as it pretty neatly wraps up the early years of the project, spurred by Phil's trip to Norway.
These early days of Mount Eerie saw the project attempting to ground itself and gain a foothold, and so a lot of the records released in this time are quite scattered and short, unpolished. Namely [[SINGERS]], [[White Stag]], [[Seven New Songs]] and [[Eleven Old Songs]], and this record acts as a very beautiful bookend to this period of tracks.
Performed in a stripped back, lonely manner, this almost acts as a reference for the other versions of the tracks. a "definitive version" I guess.
