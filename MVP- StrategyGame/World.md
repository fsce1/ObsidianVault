-Not Sci-fi!!

-Real Conflicts?
	-Modern real guns, Sig Spears, M16A5s or whtvr
	-Near-future conflict between America and an Eastern European state (post-soviet countries)
		You play as group of rebels

-Post-Apocalypse?
	-makes salvaging weapons + unreliable guns more believable
	-Rag-Tag team of unlikely people (makes sense with randomised pawns)
