## Good
- I like the lighting you have in the scene, it goes well with the colour scheme and the overall atmosphere of the room
- Well detailed. Realistic lighting. Shading is good.
very good theme
- I love the plants which adds depth to the scene 
- interesting structer
- Roman-seque room design stands out as grand and unique, the size of the table and chairs creatse a stronger sense of grandeur 
## Improve
- One thing i would say you could improve on would be maybe adding some more plants to the room around the edges so the ones that are on there don't seem quite so "out of place" :)
- Add a bit more to the room, more tables, maybe a bar.
- fill the space more 
- fill the empty space with more plants 
- feels quite empty, maybe add more plants
- Add a carpet/floor design, and maybe add additional detail to the pillars, such as a thicker base or slightly rounder, more chiselled designs
