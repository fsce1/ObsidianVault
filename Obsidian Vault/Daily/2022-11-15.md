Music
	As much as i love Daydream Nation, I really get Sonic Youth's punk side a lot more, especially once listening to master-dik and reading the sleeve. Both sounds are interesting but honestly the raw energy of their more raw sound as opposed to the almost post-punk dreamy rock of DN. Both have their places and i get why DN was so revolutionary but i prefer the sound of their self-titled a little more.. the DN lyrics are great tho
