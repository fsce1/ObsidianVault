Blender
	Hi-Lo poly doesnt need the Hipoly to have a UV map! 
	They need to be in the same place as each other tho (I.E. both 0,0,0 in worldspace and overlapping each other)
	It uses mesh differences, not UV map differences!!!!
	also in 2D UV window you can view face stretching by going into the overlay settings (top-right of view)
