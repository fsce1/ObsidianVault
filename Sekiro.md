I'm enjoying this a lot more than when it came out.
I still think that you move strangely fast? it feels like the game is trying to get you to move past the early chapters as fast as possible.
I have to actively tell myself not to sail over the entire map and miss everything in the game.
I think this is because you have no stamina, move very very fast and have grapple
A lot of the mechanics feel very convoluted and half-baked. I dont see the reason why the game needs any currency, nor the dragonrot/divine blessing features.
The swordplay is extremely fun. Visually beautiful, the combat animations have extremely good telegraphing and shillouetting!
also the horse boss is interesting in its differences from DS3, positioning is very different as you dont want to stay underneath large beasts.
The feeling of perfectly timing a parry is like the feeling of dodging perfectly in DS3, but ON CRACK
Although the ressurect mechanic feels completely needless, why does it exist?
also the game is very pretty even playing on low (+anti-aliasing)
Biggest piece of advice i can give: LOOK AT THE BOSS
when you are starting/figuring out the controls, you stare at the player so much

Yesyes this game is good, im at Genichiro
funnily enough i got past his first phase on my first try, and his second phase on the second try.
i think hes very very well designed, i dont like his "flurry of arrows" attack that much.
It can be a little hard to distinguish which mikiri attack hes going for after the big jump attack, but this is super minor nitpick.
What i'm more annoyed by is the size of the arena. The horse boss worked very well because you could use your movement abilities to your advantage and fly all around the arena. With Genichiro it VERY often ends up in you cornering the dude which like. im sorry lol that must be annoying for him and doesnt feel extremely fun or fair.
An even worse culprit of this is the guy you fight once you return to the starting well of the game.
He very much feels like a mini-boss that should NOT be there, but in some larger arena (around the size of lady Butterfly's area. Butterfly is great btw, havent beat her yet tho.)
I love how after a big flurry of attacks and deflects, the breather has me and genichiro playing a matching animation of gaining balance in sync. it just looks cool!
Yet to understand how the gun enemies work. i think i am fighting 2 instances of ms. snake eyes and both fights feel very very fustrating as you get randomly blunderbussed from the other side of the map 0-0.
Still havent found a moment where ive *really* needed to use any prosthetics, or weapon arts, or sugars. maybe the game will get much harder but ive heard Genichiro is a fairly hard fight? i think??
Currently fighting the big spear guy that appears when you return to the start of the game again (by the temple where you met the immortality kid). hes very fun!
