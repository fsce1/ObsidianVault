Custom Maps.
	-BSP/Brush-based map editor where player can add voxels + create custom terrain
	-Each Voxel's side can display a custom 512x512 texture (like brushes in Hammer Editor)
	low cover and full cover = 1 block and 2 block height
	Half-Life: Tactics?
	Object Textures based on tilemap sprite thats put into a new material



	



Multiple people.
	-First map, one player, the city map that is already designed
	-Slowly build more people over game, around halfway through you have 3 people and its capped at 3 for rest of game
	-Limited ammo maybe not the best idea, as luck-based shooting makes it frustrating.

XCOM, but faster paced.
	-No dedicated camera/animations for shooting
	-Fog of war mechanic so you cannot map the entire map out before playing.
	-Not turn based, however able to pause game
		-Game not intended to be played with lots of pausing, maybe some form of penalty?
		-Maybe not allowed to control pawns while paused, but able to observe playing board

Rimworld (Combat).
	-No "Acquire Target" time once told to attack
	-Setting up ambushes with queued actions? ("When enemy gets this close, automatically attack")
	-Randomised Pawn Attributes- gun handling (time between shots), accuracy, run speed, stealth
	-Not as automated as Rimworld, but action queue (Move to this cover, then shoot this enemy)
		-Sims 4?

Controls.
	-Clicking not needed, just start dragging pawn and release on object to perform action on (or blank space to move there)
		-If has multiple actions, bubbles appear in adjacent directions (like the Tumblr quick-reblog feature)
	-Actions need to be very readable, as you are controlling >1 person at a time
		-Walking speed could be quite slow. Perhaps different "Stances" for pawns that affect stealth and speed

Looter Mechanics?
	-Tarkov or STALKER-style weapon attachments
		-Choose which gun to suppress/attach scope
		-Most attachments can go on any gun for simplicity
	-Pick-up Armour
		-Speed + Weapon Handling decrease (quality-dependent)

Enemies.
	-Single-player
	-Should appear smart
	-[[HealthSystem]]
